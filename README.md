# VANET–UAV Federated Intrusion Detection (Simulation)

Simulation-based evaluation of Byzantine-robust federated learning
for intrusion detection using CIC-IDS2017.

## Setup
1. Create virtual environment
2. Install requirements
3. Configure parameters in config/config.yaml

## Structure
- data/: raw and processed datasets
- preprocessing/: data ingestion and cleaning
- models/: neural networks
- fl/: federated learning logic
- attacks/: Byzantine attacks
- experiments/: runnable experiments
- utils/: metrics and helpers

## Notes
- Raw data is not tracked in git
- All results are simulation-based
